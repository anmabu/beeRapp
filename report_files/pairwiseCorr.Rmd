### Analysis summary


The correlation coefficient (r) shown on the plots corresponds to the ``r params$corrtype`` correlation coefficient.\
Only pairwise correlations with a p-value < ``r params$pval`` were calculated. \
Correlation coefficients and p-values were calculated with the cor.test() function. \
P-values were not corrected for multiple comparisons.

### Session info
This analysis was performed with beeRapp's 'Pairwise Correlations' module. \
The following R version and packages were used for the analysis.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
info = c(paste ("R", paste0(R.Version()[c("major","minor")], collapse = ".")),
paste("ggplot2", packageVersion("ggplot2")),
paste("stats", packageVersion("stats")))
print(info)
```
