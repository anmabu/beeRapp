### Analysis summary

Your input matrix contained ``r params$dim`` variables.\
Pairwise correlations correspond to the ``r params$corrtype`` correlation coefficient.\
Only correlations with a p-value < ``r params$pval`` are shown on the matrix. \
P-values are not corrected for multiple comparisons.

### Session info
This analysis was performed with beeRapp's 'Correlation Matrix' module. \
The following R version and packages were used for the analysis.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
info = c(paste ("R", paste0(R.Version()[c("major","minor")], collapse = ".")),
paste("Hmisc", packageVersion("Hmisc")),
paste("corrplot", packageVersion("corrplot")))
print(info)
```
